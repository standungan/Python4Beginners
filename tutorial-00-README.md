Welcome to Python for Beginners! This comprehensive tutorial series will take you from zero programming knowledge to being able to create your own Python programs. The course is divided into two parts:

1. **Python Fundamentals (Chapters 1-10)**: Learn the basics of Python programming through hands-on examples and a practical project.
2. **Object-Oriented Programming (Chapters 11-13)**: Master advanced concepts and design patterns to write professional-grade Python code.

The course is designed to be practical, hands-on, and beginner-friendly, with each chapter building upon the previous ones.

## Who This Is For
- Complete beginners with no programming experience
- Anyone wanting to learn Python from scratch
- Self-learners looking for hands-on practice
- Students needing a structured approach to Python

## How to Use This Tutorial
1. Start from Chapter 1 and work through each chapter in order
2. Type out and run all code examples yourself
3. Complete the practice challenges before moving on
4. Review the chapter summaries to reinforce learning

## Prerequisites
- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Python 3.6 or later installed (instructions in Chapter 1)
- A text editor or IDE (we recommend VS Code)
- Basic computer skills (typing, file management)
